# Formatting
Generally good. Just remember to add "Group" infront of the group number on the cover page to show what the number actually refers to. 

# General
You could in some cases have been better at actually saying things in the approriate chapter. 
Now and again you either write something not important in this chapter or not within its 

# Introduction
This is one of the Chapters where you don't present what you are actually supposed to present. 

Comments:
- Why do you use IPv4 in the first sentence? I think what you probably wanted to use instead was iptables maybe?
- We don't think it is appropriate to refer to the "Lab PM". We are supposed to view ourselves as consults in this assignment. 
- Your description of a stateful firewall is not very good. Furthermore, that description is not supposed to be presented in that part of the text. At that moment you are supposed to talk about what the goals of the report is. You could mention the firewall if you want but not describe it here.
- The "drop all traffic not allowed" rule 

# Chapter 2

Comments:
- Remove "mentioned earlier" from the first sentence. This is the start of a new chapter, it should be self-contained. 
- Poor description of OpenSSH. SSH is mainly used for remote control of a system. It can be used to forward traffic (or tunneling as you called it) but that is just one very specific use of it. 
- A more common description of Apache is a Web server. 

## 2.1

# Chapter 3
This chapter is generally good and with 

You are using numbered lists in thie Chapter but the numbers has nothing to do with eachother. 
Maybe use a simple point-list instead in 3.1 and keep the numbers in 3.2. 
We like how 3.2's numbers are refering to the numbers in the Firewall configuration listing, maybe just comment more clearly on that fact.

# Chapter 4
Good.

# Chapter 5

Comments:
- Don't say that it is only "in some ways stateful" after you in previous chapters called it stateful. Either remove "in some ways" or remove the sentence completly.
- Why do you write snort after the NIDS? Snort is one implementation of a NIDS.
- In the last sentence, switch "possibly" for "possible". 

# Chapter 6

Comments:
- Remove "not limit ... too much" from the second sentence. What does "not too much" mean? Is it a little or not at all? A better description would be that your goal was to "keep the applications running without interference" or something.
